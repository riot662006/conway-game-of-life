# Conway's Game Of Life - Python Simulator
This repository is an implementation of [Conway's Game Of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) in Python.

## Current Features
 - Simulates cellular automata (in the form of white rectangles) on a screen (in the form of a gray rectangle).
 - Add custom and predefined patterns to board using Pattern class and Pattern.open()
[*Find some predefined patterns in game/entities/common_patterns folder*]
 - Pause simulation and move frame by frame

## Future Updates
 - Implementation of a control system for the simulation, enabling users to rewind, reset, and adjust the simulation speed.
 - Integration of a creative system that allows users to edit the simulation at any point (or just the beginning idk).
## Modules used
- Pygame
